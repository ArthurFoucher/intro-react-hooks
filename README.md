This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a short intro to React Hooks, implementing the code written in the intro described in [the workshop on Notion](https://www.notion.so/cardiologs/Intro-to-React-Hooks-367b97899e9f4f9ca9e1b6ee6ae1d4d4).

Use `yarn start` to launch the dev server.
